# Massage Therapist Profile Application

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application for displaying massage therapist profiles with a modern, minimalist dark-themed design. The application showcases therapist information including services, pricing, testimonials, travel schedules, and photo galleries. Built with React, Express, and designed with a radical minimalism approach inspired by x.ai's design philosophy.

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework & Build System**
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type-safe component development
- **Vite** as the build tool and development server, providing fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
- **Wouter** for client-side routing instead of React Router, chosen for its lightweight footprint
- **TanStack Query (React Query)** for server state management, data fetching, and caching

**UI Component Library**
- **shadcn/ui** components built on top of Radix UI primitives
- Provides accessible, customizable components following the "New York" style variant
- All UI components are local to the project (in `client/src/components/ui/`) for full customization control

**Styling Solution**
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling with custom CSS variables for theming
- Dark mode only design with pure black backgrounds and high contrast
- Custom color palette defined in CSS variables: electric blue (210 100% 60%) and soft purple (270 70% 65%) as accent colors
- Typography using Inter and DM Sans font families from Google Fonts
- Design follows extreme minimalism with generous whitespace and restrained accent usage

**State Management**
- Server state: TanStack Query handles all API data fetching, caching, and synchronization
- Local component state: React hooks (useState, useEffect) for UI interactions
- No global state management library (Redux, Zustand) needed for this application's scope

**Component Structure**
- Page components in `client/src/pages/` (therapist-profile.tsx, not-found.tsx)
- Reusable feature components in `client/src/components/` (image-gallery, price-card, testimonial-card)
- shadcn/ui components in `client/src/components/ui/`
- Custom hooks in `client/src/hooks/`

### Backend Architecture

**Server Framework**
- **Express.js** with TypeScript for the REST API server
- Modular route registration pattern separating concerns
- Middleware for JSON parsing, logging, and request timing

**API Design**
- RESTful endpoints under `/api/` prefix
- Main endpoint: `GET /api/therapist/:id` returns complete therapist profile with related data
- Additional endpoint: `GET /api/therapist/:id/testimonials` for testimonial-specific queries
- All API responses return JSON
- Error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes (404 for not found, 500 for server errors)

**Data Layer Abstraction**
- Storage interface (`IStorage`) defines contract for data operations
- `MemStorage` class implements in-memory storage for development/testing
- Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL production database migration
- Clean separation allows swapping storage implementations without changing business logic

**Development vs Production**
- Development: Vite middleware integrated with Express for HMR and fast refresh
- Production: Static file serving of built React application
- Custom logging middleware tracks API request timing and responses

### Database Schema

**ORM & Migrations**
- **Drizzle ORM** configured for type-safe database queries
- PostgreSQL dialect with Neon Database serverless driver (@neondatabase/serverless)
- Schema defined in `shared/schema.ts` for sharing types between frontend and backend
- Drizzle Zod integration for runtime validation
- Migration files generated in `./migrations` directory

**Schema Design**
- **therapist_profiles**: Core therapist information (name, title, bio, contact, services)
  - Uses JSONB columns for arrays (techniques, amenities, affiliations, gallery)
  - UUID primary keys generated by database
  - Timestamps for record creation tracking

- **travel_schedule**: Therapist location availability
  - Foreign key reference to therapist_profiles
  - Date ranges (startDate, endDate) stored as text
  - Boolean flag (isCurrent) for active locations

- **pricing**: Service pricing tiers
  - Duration in minutes, price in cents/dollars
  - Optional description field
  - Recommended pricing flag for highlighting

- **testimonials**: Client reviews
  - Client initials for privacy
  - Rating system (1-5 stars)
  - Service type and location context

- **specials**: Promotional offers
  - Title, description, and validity dates
  - Active status flag

**Type Safety**
- Shared TypeScript types exported from schema
- Insert types generated by Drizzle for create operations
- Full type inference from database schema to API responses

### External Dependencies

**Database**
- **Neon Database** - Serverless PostgreSQL provider
- Connection via `@neondatabase/serverless` driver
- Environment variable `DATABASE_URL` required for connection

**UI Framework**
- **Radix UI** - Headless component primitives for accessibility
  - 20+ component packages (accordion, dialog, dropdown-menu, etc.)
  - Provides keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, and focus management

**Styling & Design**
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **class-variance-authority** - For component variant management
- **clsx** & **tailwind-merge** - Conditional className utilities
- **Google Fonts** - Inter and Roboto font families loaded via CDN

**Form Handling**
- **React Hook Form** - Form state management (dependency present, not yet utilized)
- **@hookform/resolvers** - Validation resolver integration
- **Zod** - Schema validation (via drizzle-zod)

**UI Enhancements**
- **embla-carousel-react** - Touch-friendly carousel component
- **cmdk** - Command menu component for keyboard-driven interfaces
- **date-fns** - Date manipulation and formatting utility
- **Lucide React** - Icon library

**Development Tools**
- **Replit plugins** - Development banner, cartographer, and runtime error modal for Replit environment
- **tsx** - TypeScript execution for development server
- **esbuild** - Fast bundler for production server build

**Session Management**
- **connect-pg-simple** - PostgreSQL session store (configured but not actively used in current implementation)
